# Main-Project
HR Analytics- Predict Employee Attrition

## HR Analytics ‚Äì Predict Employee Attrition üö®
This project analyzes employee attrition using classification models and explains the driving factors behind resignations using SHAP. It also provides visual insights using Power BI.


## üìå Objective
Identify key factors influencing employee resignation.
Build machine learning models to predict attrition.
Interpret predictions using SHAP.
Create interactive dashboards in Power BI.
Recommend actionable strategies to prevent future attrition.


## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Seaborn
- Power BI: Data visualizations & slicing
- SHAP (for model explainability)
- Colab: Model development
- Excel: Input dataset
- GitHub: Version control


## üîç EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Identified key factors affecting attrition
- Analyzed department-wise trends and salary-level impact
- Visualizations done using Seaborn and Power BI


## ü§ñ Model Building
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression (with `max_iter=1000`)
- Feature engineering: Label encoding for categorical columns
- Train-test split applied


## üß™ Evaluation
- **Classification Report:** `classification_report.csv`
- **Confusion Matrix:** `confusion_matrix.png`
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score computed


## Project structure

## üìä Power BI Dashboard
- File: `hr_attrition_analysis.pbix`
- Interactive visuals:
  - Attrition by department
  - Salary vs. attrition
  - Time spent at company vs. attrition
  - Slicer to filter employee left/stayed


## üìà SHAP Analysis
- Used SHAP to explain model predictions
- Identified key influencers like satisfaction level, monthly hours, and promotion status

## ‚úÖ How to Run (Locally)
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn streamlit joblib shap


## Insights & Recommendations
1. Employees with low satisfaction and no promotions in the last 5 years are at higher risk of leaving.

2. Departments with higher workloads should be monitored.

3. Increasing employee engagement and internal mobility may reduce attrition.
